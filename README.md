# üìù HeisenFlow Task Management System

Welcome to the Task Management System! This project is built with Golang and Fiber, designed to help you manage tasks efficiently. Let's dive into the details!

## üöÄ Project Summary

### **User Registration and Authentication**
- **Sign Up**: Users can register by providing their name, email, and password.
- **Log In**: Post-registration, users log in with their credentials, undergo authentication, and gain access to protected resources. Access control ensures user data security.

### **Notification Inbox**
- **Events**: User-related events like invitations to new boards, task status changes, and new notifications are timestamped and maintained.
- **Status**: Messages can be marked as read or unread, and users can change their status.

### **Board Management**
- **Create Boards**: Users can create new boards, which function as independent projects containing tasks and subtasks.
- **Visibility**: Boards can be private (visible only to invited members) or public (visible to all users).
- **Roles**: Each user on a board can have one of four roles: viewer, editor, maintainer, or owner, with varying levels of access and permissions.

### **Task and Subtask Management**
- **Role-Based Activities**: Tasks can have an unlimited number of subtasks in a hierarchical structure.
- **Columns**: Boards must have various columns, including a "done" column for completed tasks. Columns and tasks can be reordered for optimal workflow management.
- **Task Details**: Users can create new tasks with details such as name, description, start/end dates, assignees, and story points.
- **Comments and Notifications**: Task comments are role-based, and status changes trigger notifications to relevant users.
- **Dependencies**: Task dependencies are tree-structured without loops, and completed tasks become independent.
- **Progress Tracking**: Users can track subtask progress, and tasks can be imported/exported in various formats.
- **Custom Fields**: Users can define custom fields for tasks.

### **Technical and Implementation Requirements**
- **Git Workflow**: Use appropriate git workflow for teamwork.
- **Frameworks and Packages**: Utilize preferred frameworks and packages.
- **Docker**: Dockerize the project with at least two containers (application and database) connected via Docker network.
- **Modular Structure**: Implement a modular structure.
- **Database**: Store data in a relational database like MySQL.
- **Logging**: Log transactions in dedicated log files, e.g., `transaction.log`.
- **Security**: Hash sensitive data like passwords and use UUIDs for unique identifiers.
- **Custom Exceptions**: Define and manage custom exceptions.
- **Unit Tests**: Implement unittests for all project components.
- **Caching**: Cache data to improve system performance.
- **API Documentation**: Fully document APIs and modules, ensuring all backend routes have Swagger UI for request/response testing.
- **Secure Methods**: Use secure methods for user data and transaction storage to prevent attacks.
- **Notification System**: Implement a notification system for task status updates.
- **Creative Enhancements**: Additional features and creative enhancements are encouraged if the primary project scope is met.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run the Project

### Method 1: Using Docker
**Prerequisites**: Docker

1. Rename the `config.yaml.example` file to `config.yaml`.
2. Run the `make dockerize` command.
3. If you haven't changed the variables in the `config.yaml.example` file, you will see the main page of the application by clicking the link http://0.0.0.0:8080 in your browser.

### Method 2: Using Pre-installed PostgreSQL, Redis, and Go
**Prerequisites**: Go, PostgreSQL, Redis

1. Change the file `config.yaml.local-example` to `config.yaml` and fill its values according to the settings of your local databases.
2. Run the `make run` command.
3. Now you will have the project running according to the `config.yaml` values.

### Running Tests
- Use the `make test` command to run the tests.
